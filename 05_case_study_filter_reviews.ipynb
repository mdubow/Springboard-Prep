    "# Extracting desired business reviews\n",
    "In the last notebook we achieved two things. Firstly, we identified the business categories (Italian/Pizza) that our campaign was going to target. Secondly, we identified business IDs associated with those categories. Knowing the business IDs allows us to select just the reviews of interest from the reviews file. Before you go rushing into reading the review data into one big dataframe to then filter just those IDs of interest, as a data scientist you will have first got an idea of the size of the file. The review file is pretty big (nearly six million lines). Unless you have a very good computer with lots of RAM, or you particularly want to fire up your system/memory monitor and watch the free memory fall further and further until your computer seizes, you should be thinking in terms of how to read in only the lines of interest. This way, you only consume the minimum RAM necessary. Of course, in general, even then you should be making some sort of calculation as to whether even this would be within the capabilities of your hardware. In this case, it should be doable for most modernish computers. The task of this notebook is to parse the review data file and save the (much smaller) subset of interest."

If this ID is contained in our list of wanted IDs, we will keep that row. It will be fastest, but most expensive for memory, to read the entire file from disk in one go and then filter the rows in memory. At the other extreme it will be most memory efficient to read in one record at a time, check whether we want it or not (and discard if not), but slowest. We will strike a balance where we choose a sufficiently large chunksize that still fits easily in memory but whereby we don't need to read in too many chunks."
